# üì¢ Introduction

Octo is built to make building websites simple and to utilize modern JavaScript standards by using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
to compile source code to allow the use of ES5 classes within node. Octo uses [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) under the 
hood for fast and reliable request processing. This allows you to use already well developed plugins/integrations with Octo.

We started to develop Octo because we found that making websites was too messy with long index, routes and middleware files. Octo is 
designed to have simple easy to read files which are specific to one task making it easy to organize and maintain source files.

# üì° Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save @hamistudios/octo
```

# üöÄ Getting started

We have created a simple [starter/demo repo](https://github.com/HamiStudios/octo-starter) with a simple webstie made in Octo, you can clone the repo to get to grips with 
the framework and also use it as a starting point for your next big project.

To get started clone the repo, install the dependencies and start the dev server.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HamiStudios/octo-starter
$ cd octo-starter
